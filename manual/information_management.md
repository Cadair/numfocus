Information management
======================

This chapter attempts to give a high level overview of which systems
we have to manage information and assets, and how that's organized
practically (who has access, who admins, etc.).

TODO: add description of backup strategy to sections


Google Drive
------------
The NumFOCUS folder on Google Drive contains the vast majority of all
documents, spreadsheets, presentations and other material relevant for
the daily operations of NumFOCUS.

Owners:
- ga@numfocus.org (the general admin account)

Edit rights:
- all staff
- all board members
- all advisory board members

View rights: Some documents are shared with people outside the NumFOCUS
organization.  No one has view rights to the whole folder.

Access rights manager: Executive Director


Github: NumFOCUS organization
-----------------------------

Owners:
- Executive Director
- President
- Treasurer
- Secretary

Edit rights:
- all staff
- all board members
- all advisory board members

View rights: none

Access rights manager: Secretary


numfocus.org website
--------------------
This site is now hosted on Flipcause, which has a WYSIWYG editor without
version control.  We should be moving away from that soon, back to
something more maintainable hosted on GitHub.

Owners:
- staff member leading Marketing

Edit rights:
- all staff
- all board members

View rights: the site itself is public, the code running it should become
public.

Access rights manager: staff member leading Marketing


Github: PyData organization
---------------------------
It's unclear who should have what rights here.  This org houses projects
that have no common development team, board members currently have no
access, PyData is a NumFOCUS brand.  TODO: clarify this.

Owners:
- ?

Edit rights:

View rights:

View rights: the site itself is public, the code running it is where (TODO)?

Access rights manager: staff member leading Marketing


NumFOCUS email addresses and lists
----------------------------------
Each staff member gets a ``firstname@numfocus.org`` address.
Those are all Gmail addresses, and can be managed via the
ga@numfocus.org account.  Most board members do not have personal numfocus.org
email accounts at the moment; if necessary an address can be created
for a board member though.

Furthermore there are a number of non-personal addresses:
- info@numfocus.org : general contact address, email goes to all staff
  members and the president.  Replies to incoming emails should be sent either
  from this account or it should be Cc'd, so a history of communications is
  kept.
- directors@numfocus.org : the mailing list for the board.  All board
  members, the executive director and the staff member in charge of preparing
  board meetings are on this list This list is private.
- project@numfocus.org : This mailing list has one or two contacts per
  sponsored project on it.  Projects can communicate with each other here,
  and staff can communicate with all projects at once (collecting items
  for the newsletter, announcements, etc.).  This list is private.
- fellowships@numfocus.org : email address for queries about fellowships,
  and where people can send their applications.  TODO: who receives email?
- numfocus@googlegroups.com : the main mailing list for the community.
  This list is public, anyone can join (no approval needed).
- admin@numfocus.org : this mailing list was previously used for the board
  (until ~2014), and is now being used for communication between staff.
- ga@numfocus.org : the admin account for all Google email addresses,
  groups and Google Drive.  The executive director and president have access.
- treasurer@numfocus.org : for the treasurer and financial admin.
  The treasurer, president, executive director and staff member in charge of
  accounting have access.


Domain names
------------
NumFOCUS holds domain names for itself as well as for a number of projects.
The domain name registrar for all those domains is namecheap.com.
Alerts are sent by the registrar when a domain is about to expire; the
executive director and president receive this.  The executive director takes
care of renewals.


Accounting system
-----------------
NumFOCUS uses the [Financial Edge](https://www.blackbaud.com/fund-accounting/financial-edge-7)
accounting system.
TODO:
- who has access?
- what overviews are generated from it and when and to whom are those
  distributed?


Bank accounts
-------------
NumFOCUS is banking with BBVA; the executive director is authorized
for "admin" actions on the accounts.  The staff member in charge of accounting
can make transactions.

Furthermore there are credit cards connected to these accounts.
TODO: who has one?
