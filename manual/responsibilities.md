Responsibilities
================

This document provides a summary of activities, tasks and things that the
board and executive director are responsible for.  Note that this focuses on
assigning responsibility of concrete practical things; the
[Bylaws](http://www.numfocus.org/uploads/6/0/6/9/60696727/bylaws.pdf) list legal
responsibilities.  There should not be any conflicting statements between
this text and the Bylaws, but if there are then the Bylaws take precedence.

Note: the following responsibilities mean that the person having the
indicated role is accountable and should know how things work and what is
happening for a given area of responsibility.  It does *not* mean that he/she
has to do the actual work (in many cases, staff will do that).  The
NumFOCUS board has aspects of both a working board (where board members
perform tasks like fundraising, publishing board meeting minutes, etc.)
and a governance board (oversight of staff activities, creating policies, etc.)
