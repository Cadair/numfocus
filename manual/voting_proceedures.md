# Voting Procedures

There are two mechanisms for voting by the NumFOCUS Board, asynchronously via GitHub or synchronously at a board meeting.

## Asynchronous voting
For asynchronous voting, a resolution will be proposed as a ticket on the numfocus-board GitHub repository. Each voting board member can discuss the resolution on the ticket. If the board member feels there is no further discussion needed they may cast a vote as one of the following:  

+ 1 : I approve this resolution
+ 0 : I abstain from voting on this resolution. I may have a conflict of interest or believe it is not necessary but will not oppose it.
- 1 : I feel this resolution needs discussion at a board meeting.

If a quorum of voting board members vote +1 without any -1 votes in 5 days (24 hour periods, not business days), the resolution passes and will be ratified at the beginning of the next board meeting.

If the resolution doesn't meet a quorum of +1 votes, or has any -1 votes, the voting will be moved to a board meeting.

## Synchronous voting

For any resolution that requires more discussion and on the spot debate, we recommend the moving of a resolution to discussion at a board meeting.

During a board meeting a resolution can be added to the agenda by contacting the chair of the board and supplying the necessary documentation to make a decision beforehand via a GitHub issue on numfocus-board.

Alternatively, a resolution can be proposed during the meeting, where a voting board member can propose a resolution and another voting board member must second the vote.

Once a resolution has moved to discussion the chair will moderate a discussion on the topic. The discussion can result in a vote or tabled for further consideration.

If a vote is cast, the chair asks for a verbal negative, affirmation, and abstentions from the vote. 

The resolution can be tabled if the consensus is to not vote until more information is gathered. Often moving the resolution to the asynchronous voting process. 

The resolution, discussion highlights, and vote count is recorded in official minutes.
